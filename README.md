### ProjecOverview
The primary goal of this project is to build predictive models for estimating body fat percentage and evaluate the performance of various regression techniques. This helps in identifying the most effective model for body fat prediction based on features like age, weight, height, and various body measurements.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various body measurements (e.g., age, weight, abdomen circumference) collected from individuals, along with their body fat percentage. This dataset is available here or can be sourced from publicly available health datasets.

Features:

Age
Weight
Height
Abdomen circumference
Hip circumference
Thigh circumference
Forearm circumference
Wrist circumference
...and more
Target:

Body Fat Percentage

### Regression Techniques
The following regression techniques were used to predict body fat percentage:

Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Elastic Net Regression
Decision Tree Regression
Random Forest Regression
Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Gradient Boosting Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors Regression
XGBoost Regression
These models were chosen to provide a balance between simplicity, interpretability, and prediction power.
